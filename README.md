# .NET Reference Source for JSIL

Here next assemblies from [Microsoft .NET Reference Source](https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource) make compilable:
mscorlib,
System,
System.Core,
System.Runtime.Serialization,
System.ServiceModel.Internals,
SMDiagnostics.

Main purpose is create license clear version of .Net Framework that could be used with [JSIL](https://github.com/sq/JSIL) (see [issue 336](https://github.com/sq/JSIL/issues/336)) and probably will not work in any other environments.
